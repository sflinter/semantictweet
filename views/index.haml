    To see your twitter friends and followers as a "FOAF document":http://www.foaf-project.org/, enter your twitter screen name:

%form{:action => '/screen_name', :method => 'get'}
  %label http://twitter.com/
  %input{:type => "text", :id => "screen_name", :name => "screen_name" }
  %input{:type => "submit", :value => "Go" }

%p
  :textile
    Why is this useful? Well, for one, instead of having to hand-craft your FOAF file, or use a service such as "FOAF-a-matic":http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic you can now embed a reference to this service directly in your homepage, blog, or whatever, without ever needing to upload or update any files.

    To do so, just add the following line to the @<head>@ section of your webpage:

%p
  %code
    %pre
      :preserve
      &lt;link rel="meta" type="application/rdf+xml" title="FOAF"
      href="http://semantictweet.com/your-twitter-screen-name" /&gt;

%p
  :textile
    Of course, remember to change the @your-twitter-screen-name@ to your _actual_ Twitter screen name.

    There are a few different ways that you can invoke the service:
    * @http://semantictweet.com/your-twitter-screen-name@ (friends only, the default)
    * @http://semantictweet.com/your-twitter-screen-name/friends@ (friends only)
    * @http://semantictweet.com/your-twitter-screen-name/followers@ (followers only)
    * @http://semantictweet.com/your-twitter-screen-name/all@ (both friends and followers)
    * @http://semantictweet.com/your-twitter-screen-name/show@ (just you - no friends or followers)
